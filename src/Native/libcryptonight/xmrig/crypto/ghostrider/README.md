# GhostRider (Raptoreum) release notes

**XMRig** supports GhostRider algorithm starting from version **v6.16.0**.

No tuning is required - auto-config works well on most CPUs!

**Note for Windows users: MSVC binary is ~5% faster than GCC binary!**

### Sample command line (non-SSL port)
```
xmrig -a gr -o raptoreumemporium.com:3008 -u WALLET_ADDRESS
```

### Sample command line (SSL port)
```
xmrig -a gr -o us.flockpool.com:5555 --tls -u WALLET_ADDRESS
```

You can use **rtm_ghostrider_example.cmd** as a template and put pool URL and your wallet address there. The general XMRig documentation is available [here](https://xmrig.com/docs/miner).

**Using `--threads` or `-t` option is NOT recommended because it turns off advanced built-in config.** If you want to tweak the nubmer of threads used for GhostRider, it's recommended to start using config.json instead of command line. The best suitable command line option for this is `--cpu-max-threads-hint=N` where N can be between 0 and 100.

## Performance

While individual algorithm implementations are a bit unoptimized, XMRig achieves higher hashrates by employing better auto-config and more fine-grained thread scheduling: it can calculate a single batch of hashes using 2 threads for parts that don't require much cache. For example, on a typical Intel CPU (2 MB cache per core) it will use 1 thread per core for cn/fast, and 2 threads per core for other Cryptonight variants while calculating the same batch of hashes, always achieving more than 50% CPU load.

For the same reason, XMRig can sometimes use less than 100% CPU on Ryzen 3000/5000 CPUs if it finds that running 1 thread per core is faster for some Cryptonight variants on your system.
