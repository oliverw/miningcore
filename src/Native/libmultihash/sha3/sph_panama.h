/**
 * PANAMA interface.
 *
 * PANAMA has been published in: J. Daemen and C. Clapp, "Fast Hashing
 * and Stream Encryption with PANAMA", Fast Software Encryption -
 * FSE'98, LNCS 1372, Springer (1998), pp. 60--74.
 *
 * PANAMA is not fully defined with regards to endianness and related
 * topics. This implementation follows strict little-endian conventions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Each 32-byte input block is split into eight 32-bit words, the
 * first (leftmost) word being numbered 0.</li>
 * <li>Each such 32-bit word is decoded from memory in little-endian
 * convention.</li>
 * <li>The additional padding bit equal to "1" is added by considering
 * the least significant bit in a byte to come first; practically, this
 * means that a single byte of value 0x01 is appended to the (byte-oriented)
 * message, and then 0 to 31 bytes of value 0x00.</li>
 * <li>The output consists of eight 32-bit words; the word numbered 0 is
 * written first (in leftmost position) and it is encoded in little-endian
 * convention.
 * </ul>
 * With these conventions, PANAMA is sometimes known as "PANAMA-LE". The
 * PANAMA reference implementation uses our conventions for input, but
 * prescribes no convention for output.
