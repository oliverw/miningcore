// This is the simple implementation, where our main concern is to show our design principles.
// It is made more efficient in the optimized version, by using FFT instead of DFT, and
// through other speed-up techniques.
//
// Parameters:
// - input: the input string. Consists of 8*m input bytes, where each octet passes the DFT
//   processing.
// - m: the length of the input in bytes.
// - output: the resulting hash value of SWIFFT, of size 65 bytes (520 bit). This is the
//	 result of summing the dot products of the DFTS with the A's after applying the base
//	 change transformation
// - A: the A's coefficients to work with (since every SWIFFT in SWIFFTX uses different As).
//   A single application of SWIFFT uses 64*m A's.

// the design idea. In the optimized versions we don't do this for efficiency concerns, since
// there we compute the first part (which doesn't involve the A coefficients) only once for all
// of the 3 invocations of SWIFFT. This enables us to introduce a significant speedup.
//
// Parameters:
// - input: the input input of 256 bytes (2048 bit).
// - output: the resulting hash value of SWIFFT, of size 64 bytes (512 bit).
// - doSMooth: if true, a final smoothing stage is performed and the output is of size 512 bits.
//
// Returns:
// - Success value.
