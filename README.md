## Building on Debian/Ubuntu

```console
git clone https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore
cd miningcore
```

Depending on your OS Version run either of these scripts:

```console
./build-debian-11.sh
```
or
```console
./build-ubuntu-20.04
```
or
```console
./build-ubuntu-21.04
```

## Building on Windows

Download and install the [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)

```dosbatch
git clone https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore
cd miningcore
build-windows.bat
```

### Building in Visual Studio

- Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/). Visual Studio Community Edition is fine.
- Open `Miningcore.sln` in Visual Studio

## Building using Docker Engine
In case you don't want to install any dependencies then you can build the app using the official Microsoft .NET SDK Docker image.

```console
git clone https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore
cd miningcore
```
Then build using Docker:

```console
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 /bin/bash -c 'apt update && apt install libssl-dev pkg-config libboost-all-dev libsodium-dev build-essential cmake -y --no-install-recommends && cd src/Miningcore && dotnet publish -c Release --framework net6.0 -o /app/build/'
```
It will use a Linux container, you will build a Linux executable that will not run on Windows or macOS. You can use a runtime argument (-r) to specify the type of assets that you want to publish (if they don't match the SDK container). The following examples assume you want assets that match your host operating system, and use runtime arguments to ensure that.

For macOS:

```console
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 /bin/bash -c 'apt update && apt install libssl-dev pkg-config libboost-all-dev libsodium-dev build-essential cmake -y --no-install-recommends && cd src/Miningcore && dotnet publish -c Release --framework net6.0 -o /app/build/ -r osx-x64 --self-contained false'
```

For Windows using Linux container:

```console
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 /bin/bash -c 'apt update && apt install libssl-dev pkg-config libboost-all-dev libsodium-dev build-essential cmake -y --no-install-recommends && cd src/Miningcore && dotnet publish -c Release --framework net6.0 -o /app/build/ -r win-x64 --self-contained false'
```

To delete used images and containers you can run after all:
```console
docker system prune -af
```

## Running Miningcore

### Database setup

Miningcore currently requires PostgreSQL 10 or higher.

Run Postgres's `psql` tool:

```console
sudo -u postgres psql
```

In `psql` execute:

```sql
CREATE ROLE miningcore WITH LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your-secure-password';
CREATE DATABASE miningcore OWNER miningcore;
```

Quit `psql` with \q

Import the database schema:

```console
sudo -u postgres psql -d miningcore -f miningcore/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb.sql
```

#### Advanced setup

If you are planning to run a Multipool-Cluster, the simple setup might not perform well enough under high load. In this case you are strongly advised to use PostgreSQL 11 or higher. After performing the steps outlined in the basic setup above, perform these additional steps:

**WARNING**: The following step will delete all recorded shares. Do **NOT** do this on a production pool unless you backup your `shares` table using `pg_backup` first!

```console
sudo -u postgres psql -d miningcore -f miningcore/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb_postgresql_11_appendix.sql
```

After executing the command, your `shares` table is now a [list-partitioned table](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/ddl-partitioning.html) which dramatically improves query performance, since almost all database operations Miningcore performs are scoped to a certain pool.

The following step needs to performed **once for every new pool** you add to your cluster. Be sure to **replace all occurences** of `mypool1` in the statement below with the id of your pool from your Miningcore configuration file:

```sql
CREATE TABLE shares_mypool1 PARTITION OF shares FOR VALUES IN ('mypool1');
```

Once you have done this for all of your existing pools you should now restore your shares from backup.

### Configuration

Create a configuration file `config.json` as described [here](https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore/wiki/Configuration)

### Start the Pool

```console
cd build
Miningcore -c config.json
```

## Supported Currencies

Refer to [this file](https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore/blob/master/src/Miningcore/coins.json) for a complete list.

## Caveats

### Monero

- Monero's Wallet Daemon (monero-wallet-rpc) relies on HTTP digest authentication for authentication which is currently not supported by Miningcore. Therefore monero-wallet-rpc must be run with the `--disable-rpc-login` option. It is advisable to mitigate the resulting security risk by putting monero-wallet-rpc behind a reverse proxy like nginx with basic-authentication.
- Miningcore utilizes RandomX's light-mode by default which consumes only **256 MB of memory per RandomX-VM**. A modern (2021) era CPU will be able to handle ~ 50 shares per second in this mode.
- If you are running into throughput problems on your pool you can either increase the number of RandomX virtual machines in light-mode by adding `"randomXVmCount": x` to your pool configuration where x is at maximum equal to the machine's number of processor cores. Alternatively you can activate fast-mode by adding `"randomXFlagsAdd": "RANDOMX_FLAG_FULL_MEM"` to the pool configuration. Fast mode increases performance by 10x but requires roughly **3 GB of RAM per RandomX-VM**.

### ZCash

- Pools needs to be configured with both a t-addr and z-addr (new configuration property "z-address" of the pool configuration element)
- First configured zcashd daemon needs to control both the t-addr and the z-addr (have the private key)
- To increase the share processing throughput it is advisable to increase the maximum number of concurrent equihash solvers through the new configuration property "equihashMaxThreads" of the cluster configuration element. Increasing this value by one increases the peak memory consumption of the pool cluster by 1 GB.
- Miners may use both t-addresses and z-addresses when connecting to the pool

### Vertcoin

- Be sure to copy the file `verthash.dat` from your vertcoin blockchain folder to your Miningcore server
- In your Miningcore config file add this property to your vertcoin pool configuration: `"vertHashDataFile": "/path/to/verthash.dat",`

## API

Miningcore comes with an integrated REST API. Please refer to this page for instructions: https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore/wiki/API

## Running a production pool

A public production pool requires a web-frontend for your users to check their hashrate, earnings etc. Miningcore does not include such frontend but there are several community projects that can be used as starting point.
